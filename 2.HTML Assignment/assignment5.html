    <h1 align="center">My Favourite Hobby : Travelling</h1>
    <p>My favorite hobby is traveling and exploring new places. I enjoy experiencing different environments, cultures,
        and ways of life, as it allows me to step outside my routine and see the world from new perspectives. Traveling
        gives me the opportunity to learn beyond books and classrooms, making each journey both meaningful and memorable
    </p><br/>
    <h2>Why I Like It :</h2>
    <p>My favourite hobby is travelling. I like travelling because it gives me a sense of peace, especially when I am
        close to nature. Visiting new places helps me relax, clear my mind, and take a break from daily routines.
        Spending time in natural surroundings makes me feel calm and refreshed, and it helps me discover myself by
        reflecting on my thoughts and experiences</p><br/>
    <h2>How I Spend Time Doing It :</h2>
    <p>I usually enjoy travelling with my friends, as their company makes every journey more enjoyable and memorable. We
        explore new places, try local food, take photographs, and share experiences together. Traveling this way helps
        me create strong bonds with my friends while also learning new things about different cultures and places.
        Overall, travelling helps me feel happy, peaceful, and more connected to myself and the world around me.</p>
