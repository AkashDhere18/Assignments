    <h1 align="center">My Introduction</h1>
    <p>I am a final-year Computer Science and Engineering student at SIT College. I have a strong interest in software
        development and enjoy learning new technologies and applying them through academic and practical projects. I am
        motivated to continuously improve my technical skills and prepare myself for a successful career in the
        technology field.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy traveling and playing cricket. Traveling allows me to explore new places, experience
        different cultures, and gain new perspectives beyond my daily routine. Playing cricket helps me stay physically
        active and teaches me important values such as teamwork, discipline, and leadership. Both hobbies help me
        maintain a healthy balance between my academic and personal life.</p>

    <h1 align="center">About My Family</h1>
    <p>I come from a supportive and close-knit family that has always encouraged me to pursue my goals and work hard
        toward my ambitions. My family values education, honesty, and mutual respect, which have played an important
        role in shaping my character. Their constant support and guidance motivate me to stay focused, confident, and
        committed to achieving my personal and professional goals.</p>
